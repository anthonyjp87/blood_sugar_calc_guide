# Blood Sugar Calc Guide

This is a table for blood sugar and insulin control designed for people managing Type 1 diabetes. I've found that often when you have a low, or need to come down, most diabetics rely on basic math to determine how much to eat, or how much insulin to take. I don't like relying on simple math when a wrong answer could literally kill someone. So, I put together this spreadsheet as a way to skip the math step and jump right to the appropriate treatment.

That being the case, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with these spreadsheets before you need them and determine if they're right for you. 

# This is not intended to be medical advice,

this is just a way to simplify the math. These formulas are based on the formulas in the book, Diabeties Solution, by Dr. Bernstein.



The first page, 'Weight-Carb-Unit' calculator describes the relationship between Weight/Insulin/Carbs. This is taken from the research of Dr. Bernstein and generalized for weight. 

Use the  'Weight-Carb-Unit' by entering your weight in the Green boxes to determime how much one unit of insulin will lower your BG or how high one gram of carbohydrate will raise your BG in the Blue Box. Then, you can take this number and use it in the following pages to update the tables appropriately. 

The third, fourth and fifth page can be used calculation references when counting carbs/insulin.  Enter your own numbers in the Green Boxes and see the table output updated. These numbers are not automatically populated on purpose so that you can enter your own estimates for your sensitivity  to insulin/carbohydrate intake. 

This is also only a reference. BG/Insulin sensitivity can be different based on a myriad of factors such as: insulin on board, time of day, physical activity, menstrual cycle, type of carbohydrate, type/brand/age or insulin, basil rate, lunar cycle, etc, etc etcâ€¦


It should also be noted that if you're very small or very large the estimates will vary from the linear relationship that I've assumed here. For kids or people who weigh a lot these charts may need to be altered based on your personal experience. If you have something else you'd like to see, send me an email.
